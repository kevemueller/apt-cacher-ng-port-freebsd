This is a port of apt-cacher-ng, a caching http/s proxy specialized in
handling distribution websites.  Originating from Debian it can be used 
to cache package retrieval for other distributions as well.o

The port includes rudimentary support to add FreeBSD distribution specifics 
to apt-cacher-ng.
